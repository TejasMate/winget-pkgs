ReleaseNotes: It's finally here! After many Beta builds and many setbacks. Socially has been completely rewritten and works better than ever! Written in React, this new Socially is faster and better than V0.5. Socially will also soon be on the Mac App Store. It is being reviewed and I will edit this when it is live.
